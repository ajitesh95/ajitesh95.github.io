    <h2>Plot Square Footage by usage</h2>
    <iframe src="Usage_description.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p><strong>Description</strong>: This visualization presents the distribution of square footage across different usage descriptions for state-owned buildings. Each bar represents the total square footage allocated to a specific usage description, allowing viewers to understand how space is utilized across various categories of buildings. For this, I chose a bar chart to represent the square footage distribution, as it effectively shows comparisons between different usage descriptions. The x-axis encodes the total square footage (quantitative) while the y-axis encodes the usage descriptions (nominal). Color encoding is applied to the usage descriptions to visually distinguish between different categories of buildings. I opted for a categorical color scheme for clarity, ensuring each category is easily distinguishable. The legend is omitted as it's redundant due to the interactive selection functionality. On the analysis side, I performed a data transformation to aggregate the total square footage for each unique usage description. This involved grouping the data by the 'Usage Description' column and summing the 'Square Footage' values within each group. This transformation allows for a concise visualization that highlights the overall distribution of square footage across various building usages. To enhance interactivity, I implemented a multi-selection interaction on the legend. Users can click on specific usage descriptions in the legend to highlight them in the plot. This interactivity helps users focus on particular categories of building usage, enabling a more detailed exploration of square footage distribution based on their interests or analysis objectives. By allowing users to dynamically filter the data, the visualization becomes more engaging and informative, empowering users to uncover insights tailored to their needs.</p>

    <h2>Building age by usage and square footage</h2>

    <p><strong>Description</strong>:The second visualization leverages circle marks to plot each building's age by its managing agency. The interactive aspect is enhanced with tooltips for detailed information on hover, and color encoding by usage description to visually distinguish between different types of buildings. The .interactive() method enables panning and zooming functionalities, making it easier for users to explore the data in detail. The hover tooltips in both visualizations serve as a primary interactive feature, providing detailed information without requiring a click or external legend. This enhances user engagement, allowing for an exploratory approach to data analysis where users can intuitively hover over elements of interest for more information. </p>
